# Journey of Logic Building in C

This repository is designed to help build and enhance logic-building skills through C programming. The journey is divided into multiple days, each focusing on different programming concepts, logic challenges, and problem-solving techniques.

## Daily Uploads

- **Day 1** (01-02-2025, 11:54 AM): Introduction to basic logic problems in C, focusing on simple operations, conditionals, and fundamental syntax.
- **Day 2** (13-02-2025, 20:52 PM): A step ahead of basic c program in which it is mainly focused on the decision making structures like if else,nested if else and if-else ladder statements.



Each day will contain problems with solutions to help you learn and practice the core concepts of C programming.
