# Journey of Logic Building in C

This repository is designed to help build and enhance logic-building skills through C programming. The journey is divided into multiple days, each focusing on different programming concepts, logic challenges, and problem-solving techniques.

## Daily Uploads

- **Day 1** (2025-02-07, 10:00 AM): Introduction to basic logic problems in C.
- **Day 2** (2025-02-08, 10:00 AM): More complex problems, including loops and conditionals.
- **Day 3** (2025-02-09, 10:00 AM): Progressively advanced topics, including arrays, functions, and data structures.

Each day will contain problems with solutions to help you learn and practice the core concepts of C programming.
